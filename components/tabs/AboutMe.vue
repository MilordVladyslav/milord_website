    I have four years of commercial experience in web-development and over five
    years of hands-on experience at all. Depending on the situation I am ready
    to follow the instructions carefully or take the lead and manage the working
    process as I have this experience as well. <br />
    I’m considering myself as a front-end developer. I like simplicity and
    clarity. I’m used to take care about code quality and always willing to
    learn new things to stay helpful. You can be sure I’m a responsible person
    who is ready to propose the solution in the most difficult situations.
